This semester I am in a special topics class at the university of illinois called ECE 498HK. As part of this class me and 5 others will tape out a student designed RISC-V core, with integrated RC5 hardware encryption accelerator.
I have been in charge of writing, verifying, and synthesizing the RC5 encryption module. This development process for this module went as such: python -> C++ -> system verilog -> gate level.
