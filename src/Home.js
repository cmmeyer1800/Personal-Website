                This past summer through today, I have interned at Hawkeye 360 doing both hardware and software,
                specifically on the testing team. During which I have been exposed to many new things such as satellites,
                digital signal processing, RF data, testing of electronic hardware, and so much more! I've had the distinct
                priviledge of helping develop the testing infrastructure for satellite software.

                  For the last 2 semesters I got to serve as a course assistant for ECE391, the University of Illinois'
                  premier operating systems course. During my time I have been able to help over 600 students in understanding
                  operating systems material and also designing their own linux type OS. I have learned alot about how to
                  help others with technical tasks and specifically, how to teach tough material in a digestable fashion.

                  After talking ECE411 in the Spring of 2023, I applied and was accepted to be a course assistant (CA) for 
                  the class in the fall of 2024. I look forward to further honing my skills as a teacher and helping students.
                  Along with this I will be able to further my knowledge of computer architecture and digital logic.

                I have had the privelege of being a apart of IM at UIUC for my first 3 years of college . Starting as a member and working my
                way up to being in charge of a project on electronics. Finally to being on leadership and being in charge of all vehicle electronics.
                This was a life changing experience on top of being an incredible learning opportunity.

                During my time at State Farm I worked on the cloud team assisting with the company's move to AWS.
                Not only did I learn many invaluable skills such as AWS and Terraform, but I was able to provide value
                to State Farm by building out a large document ingestion framework in the cloud.
